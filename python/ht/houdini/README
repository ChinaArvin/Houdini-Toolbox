== Houdini Package Configuration ==

The Houdini wrapper and environment can be configured by way of the
houdini_package_config.json file.  A default implementation exists in the
package folder but you can copy the file to your $HOME folder and set user
defined settings there.

This file has two components:

=== System Settings ===
These are used to tell the wrapper where installed builds are, where to look
for files to install and where they will be installed.  It can also provide
information about where you might have compiled plugins.

=== Environment settings ===

These are used to defined various env variables and paths that should be set
when running.  Variables will be set first so that any paths you wish to set
can include them if necessary. The test_* versions are for when running using
the -testpath flag for testing purposes.


== Build Data ==

The build_data.json file  is used to define information about builds and
machine types.  It is how the wrapper and supporting code can determine what
files you can install and what the latest builds and such are.


== Build Downloading ==

The wrapper can automatically handle downloading and installing builds from the
SideFX website.  It is possible to attempt to download a specific build number
(14.0.123) or to try to get "today's" build for a specific major.minor (15.0)
combination.  Use the -dlinstall wrapper flag.

# To download and install a specific build:
wrapper -dlinstall 14.0.123

# To download and install the lastest build:
wrapper -dlinstall 15.0

To accomplish this it is necessary to log into the website.  This is
supported using a .sesi_login_details json file located in your $HOME
directory.

The following is the simple template for the .sesi_login_details file:


{
    "username": "someusername",
    "password": "somepassword"
}


When downloading packages automatically it will download them to the first
location in the 'archive_locations' list.
